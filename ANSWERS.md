- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

  Class component allows us to use methods called the Component Lifecycle.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

  componentDidMount - is invoked immediately after a component is mounted.  If you need to fetch data this is a good place to instantiate the network request.

  componentDidUpdate - can be used to change the componentâ€™s state data by comparing the current props to previous props. 

  componentWillUnmount - perform any necessary cleanup.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

     custom hook lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

  Testing our app minimizes the risk of bugs finding their way into production code, because acts as documentation for the code.
